# Recommendation-Tracker
Simple webapp that tracks recommendations given for restaurants, movies, anime/manga, and songs

My goal is to make a spin on a to do list by tracking recommendations given to the user in different categories.

Initial goals:
  Let the user sign up/log in and properly authenticate with proper buttons/links
  
  Make navbar items:
    -My Lists - will show the current items in each respective category that he user has added to the list
      -User will be able to add or delete items 
    -Restaurants - let the user search restaurants using the Open Menu API and add them to their restaurants list
    -Movies - let the user search movies using The Movie DB API and add them to their movies list
  
  Make it look nice
  
  
Stretch goals:
Add similar functionality for music with Spotify API and Anime/Manga with the Kitsu API
Add ability for user to mark items as complete
Add a history section that items automatically move in to once completed so the user can review and recommend to others
